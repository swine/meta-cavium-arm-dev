Subject: [PATCH 0380/1767] lightnvm: fix missing grown bad block type
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1531539

The get/set bad block interface defines good block, factory bad block,
grown bad block, device reserved block, and host reserved block.
Unfortunately the grown bad block was missing, leaving the offsets wrong
for device and host side reserved blocks.

This patch adds the missing type and corrects the offsets.
