Subject: [PATCH 0634/1767] irqchip/gic-v3: Make sure read from ICC_IAR1_EL1 is
 visible on redestributor

The ARM GICv3 specification mentions the need for dsb after a read
from the ICC_IAR1_EL1 register:

	4.1.1 Physical CPU Interface:
	The effects of reading ICC_IAR0_EL1 and ICC_IAR1_EL1
	on the state of a returned INTID are not guaranteed
	to be visible until after the execution of a DSB.

Not having this could result in missed interrupts, so let's add the
required barrier.

[Marc: fixed commit message]
