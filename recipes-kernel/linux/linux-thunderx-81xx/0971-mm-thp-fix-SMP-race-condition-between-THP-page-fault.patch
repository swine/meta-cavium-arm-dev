Subject: [PATCH 0971/1767] mm: thp: fix SMP race condition between THP page
 fault and MADV_DONTNEED

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1553179

commit ad33bb04b2a6cee6c1f99fabb15cddbf93ff0433 upstream.

pmd_trans_unstable()/pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() were
introduced to locklessy (but atomically) detect when a pmd is a regular
(stable) pmd or when the pmd is unstable and can infinitely transition
from pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() from under us, while only holding
the mmap_sem for reading (for writing not).

While holding the mmap_sem only for reading, MADV_DONTNEED can run from
under us and so before we can assume the pmd to be a regular stable pmd
we need to compare it against pmd_none() and pmd_trans_huge() in an
atomic way, with pmd_trans_unstable().  The old pmd_trans_huge() left a
tiny window for a race.

Useful applications are unlikely to notice the difference as doing
MADV_DONTNEED concurrently with a page fault would lead to undefined
behavior.
