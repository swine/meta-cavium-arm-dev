Subject: [PATCH 1216/1767] bcache: prevent crash on changing writeback_running

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1553179

commit 8d16ce540c94c9d366eb36fc91b7154d92d6397b upstream.

Added a safeguard in the shutdown case. At least while not being
attached it is also possible to trigger a kernel bug by writing into
writeback_running. This change  adds the same check before trying to
wake up the thread for that case.
