Subject: [PATCH 1560/1767] mac80211: minstrel_ht: set default tx aggregation
 timeout to 0

BugLink: http://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1558330

commit 7a36b930e6ed4702c866dc74a5ad07318a57c688 upstream.

The value 5000 was put here with the addition of the timeout field to
ieee80211_start_tx_ba_session. It was originally added in mac80211 to
save resources for drivers like iwlwifi, which only supports a limited
number of concurrent aggregation sessions.

Since iwlwifi does not use minstrel_ht and other drivers don't need
this, 0 is a better default - especially since there have been
recent reports of aggregation setup related issues reproduced with
ath9k. This should improve stability without causing any adverse
effects.
